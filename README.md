# Scissors Congruence

An interactive demonstration of the Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem, which states that any two simple polygons of equal area can be dissected into a finite number of congruent polygonal pieces.

The idea for this program came from a lecture at the University of Talence on the Wallace-Bolyai-Gerwien theorem, where [this program](https://github.com/dmsm/scissors-congruence) was used to induce us to the Wallace-Bolyai-Gerwien theorem.
